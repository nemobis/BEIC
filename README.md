## BEIC_pid_list.py

To make a nice table from a list of PID numbers:

* install the dependencies with your package manager (usually `python python-requests python-kitchen python-lxml`);
* save the list of PID numbers one per line in a file named `BEIC-pids.txt`;
* run the program with no arguments.

## This use of GitHub is not an endorsement

This project is archived and currently hosted by GitHub for legacy reasons.
GitHub is not recommended as it's a service running on proprietary software
and does not respect copyleft.

I can consider moving this project to a freedom-respecting forge if you
need to interact with it and you find yourself executing proprietary software
(i.e. anything beyond git commands on your local machine).
